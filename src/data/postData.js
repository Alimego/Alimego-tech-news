At the beginning of the book the writer gave detailed explanations of events but when he came to a certain part of the book he didn’t finish some of the incidents or left them hidden. A typical example was when Mgbechi sold pap on the burial day of a deceased member of the union. The author failed to tell the readers what punishment was given to Mgbechi.'
